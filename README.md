# SafiMaatje — Digital Cyber Safety Guide (EN/NL)

SafiMaatje is a friendly, inclusive digital assistant designed to help citizens, families, and small businesses in Den Haag stay safe online.

It teaches how to protect personal accounts, devices, and online identity — in a simple, human tone that works for all ages.

## Why It Matters
When someone gains access to your personal data, it does not affect only you — it can also impact the people you care about.

Someone could:
- Pretend to be you
- Ask your family for money
- Message your children as a “trusted friend”
- Lock you out of banking and apps

We learn together — to protect each other.
